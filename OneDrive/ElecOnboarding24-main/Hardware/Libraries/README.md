# isc-hw-libs
Illini Solar Car's shared libraries for hardware -- KiCAD libraries and footprints.

## Repository Structure
This is meant to be [submoduled](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) into a higher-level project.

- [layout.pretty] - Footprints go here.
- [schematic] - Schematic elements go here.
- [packages3d] - 3D models of parts go here.
- [schematic_kicad] - This is a dump of the current KiCAD library set. Don't change these unless you have a compelling reason to (ie. the KiCAD libraries have been updated)
- [footprint_kicad] - a dump of the KiCAD footprints. Same as above.
