> This template is a general guideline for ISC board specifications. Your board spec should be a high-level overview of what functions the board must have. This document should describe the features of a board, not how the board will be made. This should read like something a non-engineer could look at and understand what this board will do.

> A well-designed board specification should also contain enough information that a reasonably experienced board designer could read the project requirements and design the PCB from scratch. The implementation details should be left up to the person that will actually be designing and making the board.


# Horn Breakout Board
**Board Requirements**
Pulls 24V from the Low Voltage Bus Board and receives a digital signal from the Dash Board to sound a very loud horn

## Overview and Description
This board is for the horn of the car, and replaces the previous board that the horn used
- What is the primary function of this board?
- What does this board replace?
- One or two more bullets (if necessary) talking about other things this board does
- Other board integration (List other boards and communication protocols)
	- Board 1 (CAN)
	- Board 2 (USB)
- Wiki page: [add link to page]

## High-Level Requirements
The horn needs to be On/Off, which will be a digital signal
A horn output which will output 24V at 150mA

## Communication Protocols
digital GPIO

## Connectors
 - List any general requirements for connectors here (e.g. no through-hole, low-profile, minimum 1A current capacity, etc.)
 - Then list each connector, specific type/requirements, and pinout such as:
 - Power In (KK 2.54)
	- GND
	- +12V
	- GND

## Buttons/Switches
- If the board needs buttons, describe what they do and how they will connect to the board

## Power System
- List each source that the board will need to function within the scope of this document
	- Where does this voltage originate?
	- List what protection this power supply needs
	- List any other requirements for this rail
- List specific details in the wiki documentation

## Test Points
- Which signals should have test points?

## LED Indicators
- List any functions that should have an LED to indicate they are doing something. Include the 4 default debug LEDs for ISC boards
